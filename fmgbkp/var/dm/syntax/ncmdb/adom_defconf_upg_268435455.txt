If a wireless device or network is installed without a company&#39;s knowledge, it can allow an attacker to easily and &quot;invisibly&quot; enter the network.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> Unauthorized wireless devices may be hidden within or attached to a computer or other system component, or be attached directly to a network port or network device, such as a switch or router. Any such unauthorized device could result in an unauthorized access point into the environment.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> Knowing which wireless devices are authorized can help administrators quickly identify non-authorized wireless devices, and responding to the identification of unauthorized wireless access points helps to proactively minimize exposure of CDE to malicious individuals.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> Due to the ease with which a wireless access point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting their presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices, these processes must be performed even when a policy exists prohibiting the use of wireless technology.</p><p> Source: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3.pdf<br/><br/> Wireless access points can be a vector for attacks on your systems. Your organization needs to know the status of your access points and discover any unauthorized access points. This report provides detailed information on the status of your wireless infrastructure by reporting on Rogue APs, Suppressed APs, Accepted APs and Unclassified APs.</p><p><strong>Rogue Wireless APs</strong> are unauthorized APs attached to your wired networks. The On-Wire detection technique determines which unknown APs are rogues.<br/> In addition to monitoring rogue APs, you can actively prevent your users from connecting to them. When <strong>suppression</strong> is activated against an AP, the FortiGate WiFi controller sends deauthentication messages to the rogue AP&#39;s clients, posing as the rogue AP, and also sends deauthentication messages to the rogue AP, posing as its clients.<br/><br/><strong>Accepted Wireless APs</strong> are authorized part of your network or are neighboring APs that are not a security threat.<br/><br/><strong>Unclassified APs</strong> are the initial status of a discovered AP. You can change an AP back to unclassified if you have mistakenly marked it as Rogue or Accepted.</p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>Summary</h1><fazchart mkey=\"default-Managed-AP-Summary_table\" title=\"Managed AP Summary\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"default-AP-Detection-Summary-by-Status-OnWire_table\" title=\"AP Detection Summary (On-Wire)\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"default-AP-Detection-Summary-by-Status-OffWire_table\" title=\"AP Detection Summary (Off-Wire)\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"default-Unclassified-AP-Summary_table\" title=\"Unclassified AP Summary (On-Wire + Off-Wire)\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>On-Wire APs</h1><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Rogue-Onwire\" title=\"Rogue Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Suppressed-Onwire\" title=\"Suppressed Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Accepted-Onwire\" title=\"Accepted Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Unclassified-Onwire\" title=\"Unclassified Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>Off-Wire APs</h1><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Rogue-Offwire\" title=\"Rogue Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Suppressed-Offwire\" title=\"Suppressed Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Accepted-Offwire\" title=\"Accepted Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"event-Wireless-Unclassified-Offwire\" title=\"Unclassified Wireless APs\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart>"

These applications are commonly found on organizational networks, but their use is commonly not sponsored, especially for cloud providers. Furthermore, a number of cloud provider desktop software uses hardcoded trust authorities, rendering decryption impossible which results in having to make a policy call of either to allow or deny these applications with no possibility of decrypting their content. It is recommended to followup with users that are found to heavily use cloud storage providers if their use is not sponsored - their use may present various risks, ranging from poor credential security to replication of corporate sensititive data on non-corporate, insecure assets (e.g. home computers).</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">Sample applications in this category include:</p><ul><li><a style=\"color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\" href=\"http://fortiguard.com/appcontrol/17459\">Dropbox</a>, <a style=\"color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\" href=\"http://fortiguard.com/appcontrol/23382\">OneDrive</a></li><li><a style=\"color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\" href=\"http://fortiguard.com/appcontrol/29880\">iCloud</a></li><li><a style=\"color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\" href=\"http://fortiguard.com/appcontrol/16303\">NFS</a>,&nbsp;<a style=\"color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important;\" href=\"http://fortiguard.com/appcontrol/16719\">Rsync</a></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:start\">For more information, visit http://www.fortiguard.com.</p><fazchart mkey=\"Application-Session-History\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"><fazfilters><fazfilter field=\"appcat\" oper=\"eq\" value=\"Storage.Backup\"></fazfilter></fazfilters></fazchart><p><em>Note: The above graph presents the application category&#39;s usage during the time period category,&nbsp;<strong>hourly</strong>, up to a maximum resolution of 20 days (500 time periods).</em></p><fazchart mkey=\"Application-Usage-List\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"><fazfilters><fazfilter field=\"appcat\" oper=\"eq\" value=\"Storage.Backup\"></fazfilter></fazfilters></fazchart><p><em>Note: The above list presents the application&nbsp;<strong>combined total usage</strong>&nbsp;for the time period of this report.</em></p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1><span style=\"color:#000080\">Risk 2: General Access Categories</span></h1><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:helvetica; font-size:12px\">(Game, Collaboration, Social.Media, Video/Audio, Voip, Industrial, General.Interest, Network.Service, Web.Client)</span></p><p style=\"text-align:start\">Applications in these categories are commonly seen on corporate networks and are unlikely - to a few exceptions - to present a security threat to the organization.

It uses a customizable database of more than 5,100 known threats to stop attacks that evade traditional firewall systems. It also provides behaviour based heuristics analysis to enable the FortiGate systems to recognize zero-day attacks.

Commonly used applications such as web browsers and e-mail client applications are often targeted for the zero-day exploits because of their widespread distribution and usage; for example, attacks can send a zero-day malware as e-mail attachments which exploit vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment.&nbsp;</p><p>FortiGuard research team proactively monitors threat landscape and looks for zero-day vulnerabilities; once a zero-day vulnerability is identified, an advanced signature(s) is developed and pushed out to the customers before a vendor&#39;s patch release is available. These signatures are unique to Fortinet and play an critical role in the fight against advanced persistent threats(APTs).&nbsp;</p><p>The section below provides a summary of the files analyzed by FortiCloud Sandbox during the last period.</p><fazchart mkey=\"security-Files-Analyzed-By-FortiCloud-Sandbox\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>The list below provides some examples of the malicious files detected by FortiCloud Sandbox.</p><fazchart mkey=\"Apprisk-Ctrl-Malicious-Files-Detected-By-FortiCloud-Sandbox\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>Zero-day malware detected on the network by the on-box AntiVirus scanning, sorted by count.</p><fazchart mkey=\"Security-Zero-Day-Detected-On-Network\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>3.

A recent survey by Infonetics indicates that 77% of decision-makers at large organizations feel that they must upgrade their network security performance (100+ Gbps aggregate throughput) in the coming year. FortiGates leverage FortiASICs to accelerate CPU intensive functions such as packet forwarding and pattern matching. This offloading typically results in a 5-10X performance increase when measured against competitive solutions.</span></p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><p><br /><span style=\"font-size:28px\">Sandbox Analysis</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Today&rsquo;s increasingly sophisticated threats can mask their maliciousness and bypass traditional antimalware security. Conventional antimalware engines are, in the time afforded and to the certainty required, often unable to classify certain payloads as either good or bad; in fact, their intent is unknown. Sandboxing helps solve this problem &ndash; it entices unknown files to execute in a protected environment, observes its resultant behavior and classifies its risk based on that behavior. With this functionality enabled for your assessment, we have taken a closer look at files traversing your network.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-size:24px\">Organizational File Usage</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Total Files Detected&nbsp;(&nbsp;<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-SB-Total-Number-of-Files-Detected\"></fazmacro>&nbsp;)<br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">During the assessment period, we monitored the total number of files that were sent across your network. These files could have been email attachments, files uploaded to file sharing services, downloads from the Internet, etc. This number will give you an idea of the sheer amount of file-based activity either inbound or outbound.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Subset of Files Which Could be Sent for Sandbox Inspection&nbsp;(&nbsp;<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-SB-Total-Number-of-Files-Could-be-Executed\"></fazmacro>&nbsp;)<br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">While some file types like .png files are extremely low risk in nature, others can be executed or contain macros and other active code that could exhibit malicious behaviors. Common files types such as exe, doc, xls, and zip should be inspected for their potential to deliver threats to your network. Fortinet&#39;s sandboxing technologies can inspect more than 50 different file types even while obfuscated within multiple layers of compression.</span></span></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:710px\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"><fazchart mkey=\"ctap-SB-Files-Needing-Inspection-vs-Others\" title=\"Files Needing Inspection\" width=\"350px\"></fazchart></td><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"><fazchart mkey=\"ctap-SB-Breakdown-of-File-Types\" title=\"Breakdown of File Types\" width=\"350px\"></fazchart></td></tr></tbody></table><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h2><span style=\"font-size:24px\">Results of Executable Sandbox Analysis</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Total EXE Files Analyzed&nbsp;(&nbsp;<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-SB-Total-Number-of-Exe-Files-Analyzed\"></fazmacro>&nbsp;)<br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">As a highest risk file type, we started with executables which, after a standard anti-malware check on the FortiGate, were sent to the sandbox for further inspection.

These vulnerabilities are often exploited due to an overlooked update or lack of patch management process. Identification of any unpatched hosts is the key to protecting against application vulnerability attacks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Malware Detected&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-Total-Malware-Detected\"></fazmacro> )</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Malware can take many forms: viruses, trojans, spyware/adware, etc. Any instances of malware detected moving laterally across the network could also indicate a threat vector originating from inside the organization, albeit unwittingly. Through a combination of signature and behavioral analysis, malware can usually be prevented from executing and exposing your network to malicious activity. Augmenting your network with APT/sandboxing technology (e.g. FortiSandbox) can also prevent previously unknown malware (zero-day threats) from propagating within your network.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Botnet Infections&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"Total-Number-of-Botnet-Infections\"></fazmacro> )</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Bots can be used for launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, distributing spam, spyware and adware, propagating malicious code, and harvesting confidential information which can lead to serious financial and legal consequences. Botnet infections need to be taken seriously and immediate action is required. Identify botnet infected computers and clean them up using antivirus software. Fortinet&#39;s FortiClient can be used to scan and remove botnets from the infected hosts.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Malicious Websites Detected&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-Total-Malicious-Websites-Detected\"></fazmacro>)</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Malicious websites are sites known to host software/malware that is designed to covertly collect information, damage the host computer or otherwise manipulate the target machine without the user&#39;s consent. Generally visiting a malicious website is a precursor to infection and represents the initial stages of the kill chain. Blocking malicious sites and/or instructing employees not to visit/install software from unknown websites is the best form of prevention here.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Phishing Websites Detected&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-Total-Phishing-Websites-Detected\"></fazmacro>)</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Similar to malicious websites, phishing websites emulate the webpages of legitimate websites in an effort to collect personal or private (logins, passwords, etc.) information from end users. Phishing websites are often linked to within unsolicited emails sent to your employees. A skeptical approach to emails asking for personal information and hovering over links to determine validity can prevent most phishing attacks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Proxy Applications Detected&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-Total-Proxy-Applications-Detected\"></fazmacro>)</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">These applications are used (usually intentionally) to bypass in-place security measures. For instance, users may circumvent the firewall by disguising or encrypting external communications. In many cases, this can be considered a willful act and a violation of corporate use policies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Remote Access Applications Detected&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"CTAP-Total-RAS-Applications-Detected\"></fazmacro>)</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Remote access applications are often used to access internal hosts remotely, thus bypassing NAT or providing a secondary access path (backdoor) to internal hosts. In the worst case scenario, remote access can be used to facilitate data exfiltration and corporate espionage activity. Many times, the use of remote access is unrestricted and internal corporate use changes should be put into practice.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">P2P and Filesharing Applications&nbsp;(<fazmacro mkey=\"Total-Number-of-P2P-Applications\"></fazmacro>)</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:12px\">These applications can be used to bypass existing content controls and lead to unauthorized data transfer and data policy violations. Policies on appropriate use of these applications need to be implemented.</span></p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1><span style=\"font-size:28px\">Security and Threat Prevention</span></h1><h2><span style=\"font-size:24px\">High Risk Applications</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The FortiGuard research team assigns a risk rating of 1 to 5 to an application based on the application behavioral characteristics.

Sometimes, these applications can be used to circumvent or even replace corporate infrastructure already available to users in lieu of ease of use.

Accordingly, your data could be exposed if the cloud provider&#39;s security infrastructure is breached.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The adoption of &quot;infrastructure as a service&quot; (IaaS) platforms is popular and can be very useful when compute resources are limited or have specialized requirements.

SD WAN uses pre-defined SLA strategies to route traffic through the SD-WAN interfaces that meet the latency, jitter, and packet loss criteria configured in the SLA targets associated with the SD-WAN rules. SD-WAN constantly monitors network traffic metrics, such as latency, packet loss and jitter. Based on the measured data, the SD-WAN is able to respond proactively to real-time network conditions, selecting the optimal path for traffic.</p><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Device-Interface-Summary-by-Bibandwidth\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h2>&nbsp;</h2><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-fw-Device-Interface-Quality_Bibandwidth-drilldown\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h2>Service Level Agreements&nbsp;(SLAs)</h2><p><strong>Performance SLA by WAN Link</strong></p><p>Performance link monitoring measures the health of links that are connected to SD-WAN member interfaces by sending probing signals through each link to a server and measuring the link quality based on latency, jitter, and packet loss. If a link is broken, the routes on that link are removed, and traffic is routed through other links. When the link is working again, the routes are re-enabled. This prevents traffic being sent to a broken link and lost.</p><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Device-SLA-Interface-bandwidth-Drilldown\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h1>SD-WAN Utilization</h1><p>FortiGate can be set to recognize applications by business criticality. Business-critical applications, general productivity applications, and social media can be given different routing priorities. Unique policies can be applied at a deeper level for sub-applications. This broad application-level visibility into traffic patterns and utilization offers a better position to allocate WAN resources according to business needs. Fortinet Secure SD-WAN identifies and classifies applications&mdash;even encrypted cloud application traffic&mdash;from the very first packet. In addition to individual applications, understanding overall utilization can help with capacity planning, circuit selection, and streamlining network traffic over time. This awareness can also help reduce operational costs associated with backhauling traffic over more expensive WAN links (such as MPLS).</p><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Device-Interface-bandwidth-Drilldown\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h2>SD-WAN Applications</h2><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Top-App-By-Bandwidth\" title=\"Traffic Distribution Over Application\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Top-Application-Session-Bandwidth\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-Device-Application-sdwan-Rules-and-Ports-drilldown\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h2>SD-WAN Users</h2><p>By looking at source traffic, we can determine the originating source of any particular traffic.

Higher average log rates applied to specific hours usually indicate peak traffic usage and throughput. Calculating enterprisewide log rates can also help when sizing for upstream logging/analytics devices such as FortiAnalyzer. Keep in mind, the log rates presented here are with the full logging capabilities of the FortiGate enabled and will include all log types (traffic, antivirus, application, IPS, web and system events).&nbsp;</p><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-CTAP-Average-Log-Rate-By-Hour\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Average FortiGate CPU Usage by Hour</strong></h2><p>CPU usage of a FortiGate is often used to size a final solution properly. By looking at an hourly breakdown of CPU utlilization statistics, it&#39;s easy to get a good idea about how FortiGates will perform in the target network. Typically, with higher throughput, more logs are generated. If 75% or more utilization is sustained over a long period of time, either a more powerful model or revised architecture may be required for final implementation.</p><fazchart mkey=\"sdwan-CTAP-CPU-Usage-Per-Hour\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Average FortiGate Memory Usage by Hour</strong></h2><p>Similarly, memory usage over time is an indicator of the FortiGate&#39;s sustainability in the target network environment.

Reports can include recipients and other elements, which could help identify users in need of additional malware knowledge&nbsp;training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Depending on the type of malware, costs of successful compromise can range from an expected cost of $25,425 in the case of a small (100 record) data breach (Verizon, 2016) to much more.&nbsp; Further credentials, intellectual property and other sensitive data can be lost.&nbsp; While top data types lost in 2017 were personal, payment and medical information, credentials, internal information and secrets were also routinely stolen.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Previously Unknown Malware</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In addition to analysis against known threat intelligence, objects and URLs were also sent for dynamic sandbox assessment.&nbsp; As a secure instrumented virtual environment that simulates end user interaction with files and links, we are able to automatically assess runtime behavior of not only the initial but also full lifecycle of components and communications to identify heretofore unknown attacks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">While not 100% certain in all cases, sandbox identification is accompanied by a risk rating that ranges from malicious to clean, with low, medium and high designations in between.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can see that the majority of ratings were malicious detections made by the sandbox- above and beyond the known malware discussed in the prior section- in addtion to a small, but still significant portion of high risk files.</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"fsa-Top-Email-Risk-Files\" title=\"Top 10 - FortiSandbox Risk files found\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>&nbsp;</p><fazchart mkey=\"fsa-Email-Risk-Rating-by-File\" title=\"Top10 - FortiSandbox risk rating by file\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>&nbsp;</p><fazchart mkey=\"fml-Messages-FSA-Inbound-Only-URI\" title=\"Top 10 - FortiSandbox scanned URI\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>&nbsp;</p><fazchart mkey=\"fsa-Email-Risk-Rating-by-URL\" title=\"Top10 - FortiSandbox risk rating by URL\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">While file type mix will vary by organization, a growing practice among cybercriminals is the embedding of active code within legitimate file types.&nbsp; Especially if you are seeing a significant number of java or other scripts, Flash files or other non-traditional executables, consider using content disarm and reconstruction (at least for external-originated email to the broad population) to remove all active embedded code while preserving the original file type and initial email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Email Fraud/Business Email Compromise</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">While malicious code and URIs typically constitute the majority of attacks and risks today, there is a growing class of attacks that use neither, making detection by traditional means challenging.&nbsp; Instead social engineering is used to establish, fraudulently, a position of authority and/or trust in order to ultimately convince the end user to take an action they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Such actions could include wiring money, purchasing and sending something of monetary value or otherwise sending information that can be turned into money.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"> Of note, we identified<fazmacro mkey=\"fml-Impersonation-Analysis-Total-Count\"></fazmacro> emails that triggered our impersonation analysis, above and beyond those that may have been flagged by sender authentication checks had we deployed inline in front of your current email security solution.</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"fml-Impersonation-Analysis-Senders\" title=\"{default}\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><h2><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\">General Email Statistics</span></strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The total number of emails processed over the test period is shown below:</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"fml-Number-of-Mails\" title=\"Number of Mails\" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Advanced Protection with Fortinet Email Security</strong></span></p></div><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">As you can see from this assessment, Fortinet Email Security can help address the latest email threats and reduce the time required for security administration, incident investigation, and response.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Given the average (conservative cost) of just one incident- breach, business email compromise, ransomware or otherwise- making at least a modest investment in FortiMail as a supplement to the in-built email security of Microsoft Office 365 typically makes sense both security and financial sense.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" data-local=\"true\" src=\"/resource/images/fazrpt_external/FortiGuard-Services.jpg\" style=\"height:350px;
